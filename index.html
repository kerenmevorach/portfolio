                                I've always been a crafty gal! Recently, I wanted to start a new project that required me to purchase a sewing machine. I wasn't sure if it would be worth the investment, and whether I would get enough use out of the machine. I decided not to purchase it, and I sadly abandoned my project idea. Googlie was inspired by my own, and many others' struggle to explore their craft.

                                    I used the MSCW framework to help me determine my MVP features. I decided to focus my first prototype on the borrowing and lending process, since it felt more unique, and would likely be the most beneficial for users. I plan to incorporate the buying and selling process in a future prototype. I then created a system map to help me determine the overlap flow of the app.

                                Eggs! They’re often viewed as mundane objects. But oddly enough, they can be near and dear to our hearts. I’ve had many experiences and memories associated with eggs throughout my life. I noticed that without even realizing it, eggs have been my inspiration for quite some time.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This project explores all things eggs. I studied the egg’s form through a wide variety of methods including stories, photography, form studies, and lettering. I expressed my design process through the lens of an everyday object—the egg.

Boob Stickers is a campaign that celebrates boobs of all shapes, sizes and appearances. Create your very own pair using the boob generator, where you can adjust boob shape and size, as well as nipple size and placement. It’s time to celebrate boobs of all shapes and sizes!

                                Bright is a tutoring service for high school and university students. For this project, I evaluated a pre-existing tutor website’s account creation process to determine areas that needed improvement. I then created and tested low-fidelity prototypes, rebranded the company, and created a final high-fidelity branded prototype for the tutor website.

                                I created a generative logo for the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto, which features footwear spanning 4,500 years of history. The logo was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is inspired by the boxy shapes throughout the museum, as well as the shoebox shaped museum building. The varying heights of the letters reflect the different heights of the shoes in the museum.                            </p>

                                Crackers is, you guessed it, a cracker brand. The brand's packaging is inspired by the work of László Moholy-Nagy. Each flavor of Crackers has its own unique design. The packages feature bright colors, and a variety of simple overlapping shapes, which represent abstracted versions of crackers.

                                I created a new identity system for the Canadian National Exhibition, more commonly referred to as The Ex. The Ex is Canada's largest annual fair that takes place in Toronto, Canada every summer. The logo was inspired by the work of Corita Kent, while the type and layouts were inspired by Buddy Esquire. The identity system features a poster, tickets, and food packaging that are entirely filled with bold and playful type.

                                Growing Greens is a company that delivers cooking herbs and plants right to your doorstep. The identity system can be applied to any size box, big or small. The plant grows from a chosen letter and extends to reach the top of its respective box. The boxes were designed and constructed for chives, cilantro rosemary, basil and lemongrass.
